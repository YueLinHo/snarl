	Snarl Change Log

	- Renamed to R2.3 Beta 1  (40.54)

	- Any notifications left on-screen when Snarl is stopped (or restarted)
	  are now removed.  [SF FR 2935808]  (40.54)

	- Fixed bug where fuzzy notifications timed out even while fuzzy
	  (i.e. mouse pointer over them).  (40.54)

	- Added 'Details' submenu to notification menu.  Currently displays
	  timestamp and sending application name.  (40.54)

	- Added optional display of timestamp while mouse pointer is over
	  plugin.  [SF FR 3000019]  (40.54)

	- Prefs Panel "Display" sub pages reorganised.  (40.54)

	- Idle timeout cycle button added to "General" page.  [SF FR 2935822]
	  (40.54)

	- Class Panel sub pages reorganised.  "View only" mode is
	  now simply known as "ignore mouse and other input" and toggle button
	  in the panel now works.  (40.54)

	- Can now install new/existing Style Engines from the Style Engine
	  Panel.  (40.54)

	- sz41EzNotify() now accepts a "Value" entry (encoded as 'value' in
	  the packed string).  The concept is that it should be free-form
	  and can encapsulate the format of the value along with it - the
	  obvious example of this is a value of '45%' which would be displayed
	  by the various meter styles.  Other value types can be used and
	  defined on a case-by-case basis.  (40.53)

	- Fixed bug in the apps preferences page which was causing the wrong
	  application to be selected from the list.  (40.51)

	- Notifications (theorectially) now fade out twice as fast as they
	  fade in.  (40.51)

	- Added "IP forwarder" default style.  (40.49)

	- Fixed auto update check (same bug as for the remote icon download
	  code).  (40.49)

	- Released as 2.1A2.  (40.48)

	- Fixed two major bugs in the remote icon / delayed notification
	  handling code which in some cases caused Snarl to get stuck in
	  an infinate loop downloading the same icon.  Thanks - as
	  always - to Sven to both spotting and debugging the problem.
	  (40.48)

	- Fixed bug that meant Snarl would create JSON and SNP listeners
	  even if the appropriate setting was disabled.  Spotted by
	  Patrick Von Reth.  (40.48)

	- Notification menu now displays the creating app's name in
	  the "Close all from this app" item.  (40.46)

	- Removed the new "Snarl Apps" menu item and replaced it with
	  a new toolbar in the Apps Page.  The toolbar has two options -
	  "Details" and "Settings..." which send the registered application
	  a SNARL_SHOW_ABOUT and SNARL_SHOW_PREFS message respectively.
	  The buttons are ghosted based on the flags and application
	  specifies during registration.  Aside from neatening up access to
	  applications, this now means that applications with GUIs can
	  still be configured from Snarl as they used to be.  (40.42)

	- Fixed bug in App Roster which meant some applications weren't
	  registering correctly.  (40.42)

	- APP_SUB_VER changed to 3.  (40.42)

	- Only priority notifications are now forceably made sticky if
	  away mode is enabled.  (40.42)

	- Changed "Enabled" toolbar button on Extensions page to "Details"
	  which generates a notification showing more information about
	  the selected extension.  (40.41)

	- Fixed (again) the way extensions are loaded up and initialised.
	  new TExtension.SetTo() function is called one time only for
	  each potential extension and succeeds if the extension appears
	  to be valid and retrieves information from the extension.
	  TExtension.SetEnabled() can now assume the extension is valid.
	  (40.41) 

	- Lemon3 logging is now only enabled if debug mode is enabled.
	  (40.41)

	- Released as R2.3 Alpha 1.  (40.

	- Applications can now specify a timeout of -1 (unclear if this
	  was previously documented) which indicates that the Snarl global
	  default timeout should be used.  (40.25)

	- Applications using the V41 API can now specify a priority for
	  a notification.  This can be -1 (low), 0 (normal) or 1 (high).
	  At this time Snarl does not differ in how it handles low or
	  normal notifications, although this will change in the future.
	  The class settings panel has been changed to allow the user to
	  over-ride the priority setting for any class.  (40.25)

	- Many improvements to the underlying application, class and
	  notification handling code - provides a much more structured
	  approach.  (40.25)

	- Class configuration mini-panel re-designed to have two - Basic
	  and Advanced - pages.  (40.25)

	- Global and per class settings completely re-written from scratch.
	  Each app now has it's own configuration file which contains the
	  registered classes.  (40.25)

	- Increased V41 API support.  (40.25)

	- Added new "Copy content to Clipboard" option to notification
	  menu.  [FR2935816/dragonmage]  (40.24)

	- IStyleInstance::Pulse() is now called while the notification
	  is fading out.  (40.20)

	- Style/Scheme preview image is now automatically refreshed when
	  the style's configuration window is closed.  (40.24)

	- Bumped to R2.3a1.  (40.20)

	- Includes final misc.resource and revised Prefs Kit.  (40.19)

	- If debug mode is enabled then all extensions are disabled
	  irrespective of their inclusion within .exclude.  The 
	  .exclude file is never written in debug mode.  (40.19)

	- Improved extension handling.  Enabling/disabling an extension
	  simply moves the extension out of/in to .exclude.  Disabled
	  extensions have their icon greyed; enabled extensions which
	  fail to start have their icon replaced with a warning one.
	  (40.19)

	- Debug mode can now be enabled by holding down either CTRL key.
	  (40.19)

	- Added full-screen app detection (code from now redundant
	  DoNotDisturb extension).  (40.16)

	- Added basics for away mode detection.  (40.16)

	- \n's in the notification title or text elements are now
	  translated into CR/LFs.  Note this happens after logging so
	  the original \n's are preserved.  (40.16)

	- MakeFuzzy() routine within CSnarlWindow now uses asynchronous
	  fading (uSetTargetAlpha()) - improves responsiveness.  (40.16)

	- Released as R2.21.  (40.15)

	- Style Engines can now be loaded manually even if they're not
	  already known to Snarl.  (40.12)

	- Added 'icon' element to 'add_class' SNP action.  Specifying
	  an icon here allows it to be used for subsequent notifications
	  created with that class.  (40.11)

	- SNP protocol now takes a single Chr(13) as the terminating
	  value rather than a Chr(13)/Chr(10) pair.  (40.11)

	- Cosmetic improvements to iPhoney bar look.  (40.11)

	- Added 'icon' element to SNP1.1 'notification' action.  This
	  supports local and remote icons in the same way the API
	  does.  (40.10)

	- Stopped error dialog box appearing when unloadable style
	  detected.  (40.9)

	- SNP1.1 now reports notification token in success response
	  as SNP1.1/0/OK/nnn where 'nnn' is the token number in
	  decimal.  SNP1.1 notifications (3xx) also report the token
	  number in the same way.  (40.8)

	- Fixed bug in SNP 'notification' action handling which
	  would cause it to fail if a timeout value wasn't specified.
	  (40.8)

	- SNP bumped to 1.1.  Fully compatible with 1.0 requests,
	  it just now supports forwarding notification events back
	  to the remote application.  Notification values start at
	  302 (effectively the API notification value plus 270).
	  (40.8)

	- The icon path for notifications can now reference an
	  image located on a web server.  Currently only the http://
	  and https:// protocols are supported.  (40.7)

	- Excluded extensions were being ignored by the Extension
	  Roster during startup - now fixed.  (40.7)

	- Kill message from stop.exe wasn't properly killing the
	  Snarl process - now fixed.  (40.6)

	- Released as Snarl R2.2.  (40.5)

	- We're no longer a Beta so panel is suppressed.  (40.4)

	- Auto-update was indirectly using a SERVERXMLHTTP40 object
	  to do its stuff.  Bizarrely, this isn't supported under
	  Windows 7 (apparently being replaced with SERVERXMLHTTP60
	  instead) so we now use a SERVERXMLHTTP30 instead.  (40.4)

	- Added new S_STYLE_WANT_APP_NAME flag to Style type library.
	  If a Style specifies this option, Snarl will prefix the
	  sending application's name to the notification title.
	  Styles can then extract this information and use it
	  accordingly.  (40.2)

	- Fixed a couple of nasty bugs to do with trying to preview
	  windowless notifications.  (40.2)

	- Auto-update feature now has on/off button in preferences.
	  (40.2)

	- Removed network sending stuff.  (40.1)

	- Simplified auto update feature.  Now we simply check for
	  an update on startup and, if one is available, we show a
	  notification to that effect.  (40.1)

	- Finally bumped to V40. (40.1)

	- Dropshadow size is now configurable.  (39.86)

	- Default style is now iPhoney/Standard.  (39.86)

	- Tidied up the two "Display" sub pages.  (39.86)

	- "Use the same settings for all classes" option now takes
	  effect.  (39.86)

	- Added "Beta Usage" pop-up panel.  This appears on each
	  launch until the user acknowledges it.  This is only for
	  use in Beta releases; it won't appear in dev or finals.
	  (39.85)

	- Added auto-scheme preview (suggested by XXXXXXX) such that
	  if the appropriate <scheme>.preview image doesn't exist
	  Snarl will dynamically create one.  The dynamic image is
	  called <scheme>.prvw and is re-created each time (which
	  might slightly affect performance).  (39.84)

	- Can now unload and reload style engines.  The load ability
	  only applies to 'known' engines (that is, engines which
	  Snarl loaded up when it first launched).  (39.80)

	- Change log lost
	- ...
	- Change log lost

	- Renamed SNP return codes from SNB_xxx to SNP_xxx.  (39.39)

	- Released as R2.1 Beta 3.  (39.38)

	- 

	- Toggling the "Use same settings for each class" swtich now
	  selects the first class (<All> or <Other>) and then disables
	  or enables the classes listbox.  (39.29)

	- Style Config button renamed to 'Configure Style' and now
	  calls the Style Engine's ConfigRequested() hook.  (39.28)

	- New 'Show notification on first registration only' toggle
	  button added to General page.  Not fully implemented yet.
	  (39.26)

	- New 'Advanced' page with App Manager and Reload Styles buttons
	  moved into it as General page was starting to get full.  (39.26)

	- Styles page now has 'Configure' button back in although this
	  isn't implemented as yet.  (39.26)

	- New Prefs Kit d0 fancytoolbar used in Styles and About pages
	  to replace to multiple buttons.  (39.26)

	- Various bits of hocus pocus and other related magik.  (39.26)

	- Snarl now adds a "Local Anonymous Notifications" class which
	  snShowMessage() notifications are now channeled through.  This
	  makes it easier for the user to block them if required.  (39.22)

	- Two new private functions added - snPrivateOpenStyleRoster()
	  and snPrivateCloseStyleRoster() - which wrap the new E_MANAGE_
	  STYLE_ROSTER command described below.  (39.20)

	- Two new WM_SNARL_MANAGE commands added.  "E_MISC_CMDS" is just
	  that; a placeholder for miscellaneous stuff.  Only one sub-
	  command is currently defined - #1 - which enables the "sticky
	  notifications" option.   "E_MANAGE_STYLE_ROSTER" allows for
	  external control of the style roster with two sub-commands: #1
	  opens the roster and #2 closes it.  Some cosmetic improvements
	  have been made to the Styles page to cater for it being open
	  when these commands are received.  (39.20)

	- WM_SNARL_MANAGE constants are now named although are _still
	  private for the moment_.  This is important as these most likely
	  *will* change shortly.  (39.20)

	- Added new SNARL_COUNT_NOTIFICATIONS private command.  This is
	  due for documentation in the V40 release.  (39.12)

	- Changed URL that opens when the "Snarl Forums" button is clicked.
	  (39.11)

	- Styles page: Schemes listbox item height changed to 24px and
	  scheme icons now displayed.  (39.9)

	- Added a fix to the EZ style image loading code which gets round
	  the bug in graphics.library which locks an image file.  (39.8)

	- Apps page: apps drop-down list is now refreshed if an application
	  registers/unregisters while the panel is open.  (39.7)

	- Apps page: checking/unchecking a class had no effect.  Now fixed.
	  (39.7)

	- Released as Beta 1.  (39.6)

	- Apps page: added new 'Advanced' subpage with a single cycle
	  button which can be used to override per-class notification
	  suppression settings.  (39.6)

	- Extensions page: Ticking/unticking an extension causes the list
	  to be refreshed but doing so messed up the selected item.  Now
	  fixed.  (39.6)

	- Extensions page: Ticking/unticking an extension didn't update
	  the apps list in the Apps page.  Now fixed.  (39.6)

	- Schemes can now supply an icon that is displayed in any scheme-
	  related drop-down boxes.  (39.6)

	- Bumped to V39.  (39.1)

	- Incorporated V39 api into standard include.  (38.156)

	- Fixed hotkey bug - no longer registers CTRL on its own if
	  option is turned off (spotted by Sven).  (38.152)

	- Default style/scheme is now set in the 'Styles' page (Display
	  tabs adjust accordingly).  (38.152)

	- Fixed bug with default start positions if the relevant packed
	  data entry doesn't exist.  (38.150)

	- Added button to launch App Manager from General Page.  (38.150)

	- Can now redefine hotkey!  Only the keycode can be specified;
	  Snarl creates both hotkeys using the same keycode.  Of note
	  is that the creation function only fails if the Prefs hotkey
	  cannot be created.  (38.149)

	- Snarl now sends a SNARL_NOTIFICATION_CLOSED to the reply
	  window if the user clicks on a notification's close gadget.
	  [Specially requested by Sven].  (38.148)

	- 'About' page improved.  (38.147)

	- Minor tweaks to Preferences Panel content.  Snarl now
	  uses large icon (128x128px) when it registers itself.
	  (38.146)

	- Can now specify per-class notification position. :) Wasn't
	  that hard to add after all... (38.145)

	- Built-in styles reworked as 'Classic' style engine and
	  significantly tidied up (reduced class count again).
	  (38.144)

	- Slight re-juggling of the 'Display' tab in the Preferences
	  Panel.  Default notification position is now in the 'Class
	  Defaults' sub-page although it currently *still* applies
	  globally (but it does leave the door open for per-class
	  postion setting).  (38.144)

	- Toggle buttons on 'General' page were setting the correct
	  switches but weren't writing the config file out - now
	  fixed.  [Found by Sven].  (38.144)

	- Significant rewrite of entire style management system.
	  Style Packs are now known as Style Engines and Styles
	  themselves (in a programming sense) are now known as
	  Style Instances.  A new type library has been created
	  which covers this and should be used in lieu of the now
	  deprecated snarl.tlb.   In addition to a much cleaner
	  code layout, a number of internal objects have been
	  replaced with structs (UDTs) and the StyleRoster has had
	  a full makeover which has added a bunch of useful helper
	  functions (and removed all the useless ones).   Styles
	  can now specify a preview image which gets displayed
	  in the 'Styles' tab of the Preferences Panel.  The preview
	  images must be in the Style's path and should be called
	  either '<scheme>.preview' or 'style.preview' with the
	  former being chosen over the latter if it exists.  This
	  means styles can provide a preview image per-scheme or
	  simply one for all schemes.  (38.143)

	- T_ACTION_SHOW_NOTIFICATION icon uses a different icon if
	  the specified application was registered with Snarl.
	  (38.143)

	- Network protocol firming up.  We now support application
	  registrations and revocations, as well as (minimal) class
	  additions.  (38.143)

	- Some internal code-saving done with new TApp.Show() and
	  TAlert.Show() functions.  TAlert.Show() decodes the passed
	  parameters in relation to the class it represents (it also
	  figures out duplication suppression).  TApp.Show() simply
	  calls TAlert.Show() after figuring out whether it needs to
	  provide it's hWndReply and uReplyMsg values.  (38.143)

	- New V39 'friendly' class names now show up in Prefs Panel
	  (38.140).

	- Now processes new /etc/startup-script file (unless the
	  user blocks it by holding down either CTRL key during
	  startup).   This file is managed by the new Snarl App
	  Manager using the -add and -remove command line options.
	  (38.139)

	- Changes to the way mouse button clicks are handled by a
	  notification had screwed things up a bit in that mouse
	  capture wasn't released until *after* a notification had
	  disappeared.  Now fixed.  (38.138)

	- New WM_MANAGE_SNARL token - SNARL_RELOAD_CONFIG (9) tells
	  Snarl it's config file has been updated and should be
	  reloaded.  Note that this is for future implementation and
	  should not be used at the moment.  (38.137)

	- Released as R2.1b1.  (38.136)

	- Added new E_SNARL_CLASS_DELAY_DUPLICATES class flag (new
	  API only).  If specified, Snarl will suppress duplicate
	  notifications that happen within a specified quantum.  The
	  quantum is configurable (although not via the GUI) and
	  defaults to 2000ms with a minimum setting of 500ms.
	  (38.135)

	- 'About' page now loads up read-me.  (38.135)

	- 'Styles' page no longer has a margin.  (38.135)

	- 'Listen for incoming Snarl notifications' checkbox was
	  permanently greyed out.  Now fixed.  (38.135)

	- Removed all references/code relating to Brian's Vortex
	  framework.  (38.135)

	- Added new SNARL_NOTIFICATION_MIDDLE_BUTTON notification,
	  sent (surprisingly) when the user clicks the middle mouse
	  button on a notification.  Note that the notification is
	  *not* removed after sending the message; it's down to the
	  calling app to handle it appropriately.  (38.133)

	- Added support for right-click menu on a notification.  To
	  enable a menu, send Snarl a SNARL_CHANGE_ATTRIBUTES with
	  SNARL_ATTRIBUTE menu as the menu to change and the Id of
	  a previously created notifcation.  The value parameter
	  defines the menu content in a <item>#?<id>|... format.
	  Separators can be added by including a blank item (i.e. ||)
	  in the value parameter.  To specify an item is greyed out
	  use -1 as the <id> value.  Submenus are not currently
	  supported.  All this is private and will be documented in
	  V39.  (38.132)

	- Notifications displayed using a class are now suppressed
	  (not displayed) if the title and text are identical to the
	  previously displayed notification for that class.  (38.132)

	- New internal NotificationRoster object has meant a lot of
	  global module code could be moved into a class.  Means nothing
	  on the outside, but things are slightly neater internally.
	  (38.132)

	- Added JSON handling code.  Still rather rudimentary at the
	  moment but incoming JSON packets sent to the local host (i.e.
	  127.0.0.1) should now be recognised and displayed.  (38.132)

	- Slight (but significant) interface change to notifications:
	  now Snarl ignores a mouse button release if it's either over
	  a different client area than when it was pressed or outside
	  the notification altogether.  (38.131)

	- Holding down CTRL while right-clicking a notification close
	  gadget now adds an extra 'Capture Notification' option to
	  the menu.  Selecting this will save a PNG capture of the
	  notification (without the close gadget) to the desktop.
	  (38.130)

	- Added version info and copyright (as URL) to About page.
	  (38.129)

	- snPrivateAddClass() can now have an optional description.  If
	  one is specified, this is used in the 'Registered Classes'
	  list in Snarl Preferences.  (38.128)

	- snPrivateShowNotification() and snPrivateSetClassDefault() now
	  use the calling app's PID.  Also, snPrivateShowNotification()
	  now no longer requires the Title and Text parameters.  (38.127)

	- SNARL_UNREGISTER_APP now refreshes the app list if Snarl's
	  preferences panel is open.  (38.125)

	- Lots more work done to private functions. snPrivateRegisterApp()
	  now has its own dedicated command - SNARL_REGISTER_APP - and,
	  importantly, the order of the passed parameters has changed.  It
	  must also pass the Pid of the registering app to Snarl - without
	  this the call will fail.  snPrivateUnregisterApp() has also been
	  changed: it too has it's own command - SNARL_UNREGISTER_APP - and
	  now no longer needs any parameters, instead the api must pass
	  the calling app's Pid which Snarl uses to find the app and
	  unregister it.  This now means that *one application can only
	  register once with Snarl* which makes a lot more sense really.
	  (38.124)

	- Made some other changes to private constants and functions.
	  (38.119)

	- snPrivateRegisterConfig2() renamed to snPrivateRegisterApp(),
	  snSetAlertClassDefault() renamed to snPrivateSetClassDefault()
	  and snPrivateRegisterAlert() replaced with snPrivateAddClass().
	  Told you not you use them, nerrr.  Also added new
	  snPrivateUnregisterApp() although this is simply a renaming of
	  snRevokeConfigWindow() - it doesn't even qualify for a new
	  command message. (38.118)

	- We now take note of a class default timeout when displaying
	  a notification.  (38.118)

	- Fixed bug in EZ Style which was incrementally offsetting text
	  to the right each time a notification was updated.  (38.118)

	- Built-in styles version number changed to m.n (as opposed to
	  v.r) to follow that of EZ Styles.  Author is now returned as
	  'full phat products'.  (38.117)

	- Fixed bug with built-in styles always returning Halon instead
	  of the requested one.  (38.117)

	- Released as R2.06.  (38.113)

	- Added missing Glass Schemes and renamed Bubblegum schemes
	  to match previous ones.  (38.113)

	- EZ Style now trims title text to fit to a single line.  (38.113)

	- Style preview text changed slightly.  (38.113)

	- If the font specified in an EZ Style doesn't exist, we now
	  default to using Tahoma.  The point size specified is still
	  honoured however.  (38.112)

	- Implemented 'EZ Styles' - text-based config files which allow
	  for styles with multiple schemes.  Functionality is fairly
	  good considering the basic limitations and the 'Glass' and
	  'Bubble Gum' styles have been completely replaced with EZ
	  Styles.  (38.111)

	- 'Cancel' button on prefs panel is now 'Close' instead.  (38.111)

	- Added two new private functions - SNARL_LOAD_EXTENSION and
	  SNARL_UNLOAD_EXTENSION - which load and unload an individual
	  extension respectively.  SNARL_LOAD_EXTENSION expects the full
	  path to the extension's folder; SNARL_UNLOAD_EXTENSION expects
	  the extnension's short name (i.e. the name of the extension's
	  enclosing folder).  These functions  will be documented in the
	  fullness of time but they are not considered to be for general
	  use.  (38.110)

	- Fixed bug in Extension Roster which would send a SNARL_EXT_QUIT
	  to an extension even if it was disabled.  In most cases this bug
	  went unnoticed but disabling the SnarlClock extension would cause
	  Snarl to crash on exit.  (38.103)

	- Released as R2.05.  (38.102)

	- Fixed stupid bug which caused Snarl to crash when Save button in
	  Preferences was clicked.  (38.102)

	- Released as R2.04.  (38.101)

	- Snarl was ignoring a WM_CLOSE sent to it.  Now fixed.  (Thanks to
	  Toke Noer for spotting that one).  (38.100)

	- Can now define an 'ACK string' which Snarl will attempt to execute
	  when a notification is left-clicked (ACK'd).  This can be set on
	  a per-alert class basis (using snSetAlertClassDefault()) or once
	  a notification has been displayed using new snChangeMessage()
	  [SNARL_UPDATE_ELEMENT] private function.  All of this is currently
	  *private* and is due for documentation in V39.  If a notification has
	  an ACK string assigned to it, Snarl will simply call the Windows
	  ShellExecute() function with the contents of the string as the <File>
	  parameter - this allows for non-files (e.g. URLs) to be used.  If
	  a notification has a valid reply window and message this is still
	  sent after the ACK string has been processed.  (38.94)

	- Added new snSetAlertClassDefault() [SNARL_SET_ALERT_CLASS_DEFAULT]
	  private function which allows the caller to set specific defaults
	  for a previously registered alert class.  Currently supported
	  defaults are the notification title, timeout, icon and sound.  These
	  are used by both snShowMessageEx() and snShowMessageExByApp() if
	  any of the corresponding values passed are blank.  The timeout
	  default is not actually implemented as yet.  (38.84)

	- If the Vortex framework is available we automatically (for now)
	  start listening for notifications.  We support notification types
	  (classes under Snarl) which are registered automatically.  Snarl
	  uses two local icons - remote_app.png for the app's entry in
	  the list and remote.png in the Snarl itself.  (38.83)

	- Network tab now appears if Brian's Vortex framework is
	  accessible.  (38.83)

	- Right-clicking the close gadget of a notification now pops up
	  a context menu which allows the user to close the specific
	  notification, all notifications created by the same app, or
	  all notfifications.  This replicates the CTRL/SHIFT-CLICK
	  functionality already in place.  (38.82)

	- Renamed "Applications" tab to "Apps".  (38.82)

	- Added new "Display" preferences tab and moved parts of the
	  "General" tab content into it.  Also added new font smoothing
	  options which can be utilised by styles if required.  Options
	  are (MelonType [0], None [1], Anti-aliasing [2], ClearType [3],
	  or Windows Default [4]).  The MelonType setting can also
	  utilise a 'Contrast' percentage value.  (38.82) 

	- Added new "Themes" preferences tab and moved all the "Display
	  Options" content into it.  (38.82)

	- Added snShowMessageExByApp() which uses new SNARL_EX_SHOW_BY_APP
	  command.  This is currently *private* and scheduled to be formally
	  documented in V39.  This command allows applications to display
	  extended notifications without having to provide a valid HWND,
	  instead the application's name is used to identify the app.  This
	  can be useful for languages or applications which do not provide
	  easy access to an HWND but the obvious limitation is that Snarl
	  cannot send left or right click notifications back to the app.
	  (38.81)

	- Released as R2.0.  (38.79)

	- Default style/scheme is now "Glass/Smoke".  (38.70)

	- Made some small but significant changes to Snarl's startup code -
	  specifically around when it broadcasts its SNARL_LAUNCHED and
	  SNARL_QUIT messages.  Hopefully this should now stop some special-
	  case weirdness where notifications are displayed before the style
	  roster (and, indeed, Snarl itself) are fully up and running.  (38.69)

	- Fixed bug which meant that for both SNARL_REGISTER_CONFIG_WINDOW and
	  SNARL_REGISTER_CONFIG_WINDOW_2 the applications list *wasn't* being
	  updated if either of these calls succeeded (they return an M_RESULT
	  not a BOOL).  (38.66)

	- Moved (and renamed) the two Style interfaces into a separate tlb and
	  removed the now redundant interfaces from within the app itself.
	  The new type library will be installed and registered by the RC2
	  installer.  (38.65)

	- Built-in style pack now looks for %app_data%\Snarl\Styles\.bubblegum
	  which, if found, is used to configure the "BubbleGum" style.  This
	  configuration is on a per-style (as opposed to per-scheme) basis so
	  changes apply no matter which scheme is selected.  Note that this
	  is really only intended to demonstrate functionality; no .bubblegum
	  is created if it doesn't exist (although you can use the melon
	  Configuration File Creator tool to create one).  (38.64)

	- Released as RC1 (38.63)

	- Added snPrivateRegisterConfig2().  This extends snRegisterConfig2()
	  by allowing a large icon (ideally 256x256 pixels) to be specified
	  as well as the small icon for the registering app.  If a large icon
	  is specified, Snarl will attempt to use this in the registration and
	  unregistration alerts it displays.  Note that this function is
	  currently private and is due for documentation in V39.  For now it
	  should only be used under direct guidance from application developers.
	  (38.62)

	- Added compiler constant EXCL_PUBLIC which will exclude public
	  features of mSnarlPrivate_i when both includes are referenced.
	  As mSnarlPrivate_i and mSnarl_i are not really compatible the
	  only time this really only applies to the Snarl code itself.  (38.61)

	- Tidied up includes.  Moved commented-out Unicode support into new
	  mSnarlUnicode_i.bas include file.  Created new mSnarlPrivate_i.bas
	  include file which contains as yet unofficial functions.  (38.61)

	- Added snPrivateRegisterAlert() which uses SNARLSTRUCT->LngData2 to
	  specify additional flags for the alert.  The only flag currently
	  defined is SNARL_ALERT_DISABLED which registers the alert as
	  disabled.  Note that this function is currently private and is
	  due for documentation in V39.  For now it should only be used
	  under direct guidance from application developers.  (38.60)

	- =====

	- Removed references to "default_opacity" and "default_dye_colour" as
	  these are no longer used.  (It's up to the style to determine how
	  it looks now).  All Snarl's are displayed at maximum opacity (255)
	  in order to make the fading rountines simpler.  Styles can still
	  generate transulcent Snarls by simply drawing their content
	  accordingly.  (38.18) 

	- =====

	- Version bumped to V38.  (38.1)

	- Version, etc. changed to R1.6 final.  (37.85)

	- Released as RC-2.  (37.84)

	- SNARL_UPDATE and not specifying anything in IconPath would kill any
	  existing icon.  Now fixed.  (37.84)

	- SNARL_IS_VISIBLE now returns False once the notification starts fading
	  out, not once it's finally disappeared.  Suggested by Sam Listopad (37.80)

	- SNARL_UPDATE now resets the timeout value to what it was when the
	  notification was first displayed.  Suggested by Sam Listopad. (37.80)

	- New icons for the Preferences panel.  (37.78)

	- We now return M_NOT_IMPLEMENTED for invalid standard command values.
	  Oops.  (37.78)

	- About box revised slightly.  (37.78)

	- Application Registered/Unregistered notifications are no longer shown
	  for Extensions.  (37.76)

	- Snarl now registers itself and creates three alerts: Welcome Message,
	  Application Registered and Application Unregistered.  Should be fairly
	  self explanatory.  (37.74)

	- More debug output added.  (37.70)

	- Released as RC-1.  (37.61)

	- VB version of include file reworked to resolve bugs with the new UTF8
	  conversion functions  (basically, under VB, characters such as £ (UK
	  Pound Sterling symbol) and € (Euro currency symbol) were being lost.
	  (37.61)

	- Sound notifications improved slightly.  Also, system sounds can now
	  be played by prefixing the sound name (e.g. 'MailBeep') with a '+'
	  symbol.  (37.61)

	- Extension manager now sends HWND_SNARL in the hWnd parameter of the
	  WndProc() hook so that extensions can distinguish between messages
	  from the Extension manager and those from a window.  Note that
	  HWND_SNARL is *not* a genuine window handle; extensions which require
	  a handle to the Snarl Dispatcher should use snGetSnarlWindow().  (37.59)

	- Alerts list improved slightly.  Now, when clicking a checkbox, only the
	  icon is updated rather than the whole list content.  (37.59)

	- Various snxxx() functions weren returning True/False instead of an error
	  number.  Fixed.  (37.57)

	- snIsVisible() handling was broken, now fixed.  (37.57)

	- Added support for new snUpdateTimeout().  (37.57)

	- g_UnloadExtensions() now frees up extension dlls correctly.  This means
	  installers should be able to install over existing extensions.  (37.51)

	- g_GetExtensions() now checks a new file called 'excluded' in the extensions
	  folder.  Names of extensions that appear in this file are not loaded.  The
	  file is a standard melon config file (except it has no extension) with a
	  single [exclude] section.  (37.37)
